Description
This project provides an analysis of the COVID-19 pandemic's impact across different continents and countries. 
The visualizations highlight critical metrics such as the total number of cases, deaths, death percentages, and the 
percentage of the population infected over time. The data is presented through various charts and maps, offering insights 
into the spread and severity of the pandemic.

Tools Used
SQL: For data extraction, transformation, and loading (ETL) processes.
Tableau: For data visualization and dashboard creation.

Steps
Data Collection:
Gathered COVID-19 data from reliable sources such as health organizations and government databases.

Data Preparation (SQL):
Imported raw data into a SQL database.
Cleaned the data to handle missing values and inconsistencies.
Normalized the data to ensure efficient storage and retrieval.
Performed SQL queries to aggregate data by continent and country.
Calculated critical metrics such as total cases, total deaths, death percentages, and the percentage of the population 
infected.

Data Analysis and Visualization (Tableau):
Connected Tableau to the SQL database to import the prepared data.

Created various charts and graphs:
Total Deaths Per Continent: A bar chart showing the total number of deaths in each continent.
Percent Population Infected Per Country: A line graph tracking the percentage of the population infected over time for selected countries.
Critical Numbers: A summary of total cases, total deaths, and the death percentage.
World Map Visualization: A choropleth map showing the percent population infected per country.

Dashboard Creation:
Designed an interactive dashboard in Tableau to combine all the visualizations.
Added filters to allow users to explore data for specific continents and countries.
Ensured the dashboard is user-friendly and visually appealing.

About
